[![Panda! Go, Panda!](http://i.imgur.com/rL88eG5.jpg)](https://youtu.be/nwd9W6VwIu4)

Pandoc, wrapped in Go.

## Cloning this Project

It's better to use `go get` instead of `git clone` so that your repo ends up
somewhere in the `$GOPATH` (which is relied on by `govendor`).

``` bash
go get github.com/scripted/pandago
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/scripted/pandago
```

## PandaGo Locally

You can run the server directly.

``` bash
go run main.go
```

Compile and Run a la Heroku

``` bash
go install -v ./...
heroku local
```

Instead of running pandago, you can also run the app directly using `pandago`.

``` bash
curl -i localhost:8080
#
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
# Date: Tue, 11 Oct 2016 21:53:14 GMT
# Content-Length: 19

# {"message":"pong"}
```

## Dependencies with govendor

PandaGo uses [`govendor`](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) to manage its dependencies.

``` bash
go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor
```

You can install all dependencies described in `vendor/vendor.json` into the
`vendor/` directory by running the following.

``` bash
govendor sync
```

To update dependencies as described in the app, run the following.

``` bash
govendor add +external
govendor remove +unused
```

For more info, checkout out [Heroku's page on govendor](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/go-dependencies-via-govendor).

## Deploying to Heroku

Create the Heroku app as usual:

``` bash
heroku create
```

Add the official `heroku/go` buildpack as well as the a buildpack for installing
custom binaries so we can install Pandoc via `.custom_binaries`:

``` bash
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/go
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/tonyta/heroku-buildpack-custom-binaries#v1.0.0
```

That's it. Then just push it to Heroku like normal.

``` bash
git push heroku master
curl -i https://<YOUR_APP_NAME>.herokuapp.com
#
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Server: Cowboy
# Connection: keep-alive
# Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
# Date: Tue, 11 Oct 2016 21:51:06 GMT
